### Okay, now I am sure you won't. 

# Step 1 - Installing Atom:
- Let's begin by downloading Atom. It is a Markdown editor which available for free. You can download it on <https://atom.io>.
**Here is what it should look like when you click on the link.**

_This Markdown editor allows for Cross-platform editing, i.e. Atom works across operating systems. Use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux._

- Click on download.
- Upon completion, run the setup file. 
- Now that the installation process is done, open the editor.
- It will show you a welcome guide and options to customize your editor. 
**Here's a glimpse**

*We're not quite there yet. Let's cover the basics in Markdown.*
# Step 2 - Using Markdown
Markdown is a markup language that I learned on the fly. Unlike HTML, it is not that cumbersome for documents. I still remember my instructor mentionning that it could seriously take less than an hour to learn. It was not an exaggeration.

- Use this link to learn the basics in Markdown <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax>. It's relatively straightforward. With only a few symbols, you can simply format your resume in a neat way. 
- Once you start writing your resume using the Markdown symbols, you can see a live preview by simply using Ctrl(or Command)+Shift+m. 
**I've used examples from the link provided to illustrate how the live preview works**

- By dipping your toe in the water, you probably have now figured how Markdown works in Atom. If you spend enough time on the editor, I'm sure you will come up with a neatly formatted, up-to-date resume.
- Lastly, remember to save your resume in a .md format.

# Step 3 - Creating a GitHub account and a repository
- To create a GitHub account, go on the following link <https://pages.github.com>. 
- There's a video on the website. It will guide you on how to create a repository. 
**Make sure you watch this video**

**Note: You can also manually add repositories.** 
- Click on the top-right corner of your home page.
- Then click on "Your repositories" (circled in red).

- Lastly, select "New".

_By now, I assume you already have an account on GitHub, coupled with a repository._

***We're now ready to host our resume on GitHub*** 

# Step 4 - Hosting your resume on GitHub
- You can upload your resume.md file(written using Markdown) by selecting "Upload files" on your home page.
**Here's where you can find it**

- Your resume is now Hosted on GitHub.

_Let's apply a Jekyll theme on it_

# Step 5 - Applying a Jekyll theme to your resume
This can be done in 3 steps. 
- First, open your repository where your resume is hosted. 
- Click settings (Circled in red)
![Settings](https://github.com/KeshavModun/Resume/blob/master/IMG/Settings.PNG)

- Scroll down, until you see "Apply a theme". Choose a theme by clicking "Select". 
![Change Theme](https://github.com/KeshavModun/Resume/blob/master/IMG/Change%20Theme.PNG)

- **Finally**,  Your resume is hosted at <https://username.github.io/repositoryname/>

Wasn't that too easy? Congratulations. You now have a resume, written in Markdown, hosted on GitHub and formatted using a Jekyll theme.
